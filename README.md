Moving Average

Average definition:

The result you get by adding two or more amounts together and dividing the total by the number of amounts.

In this problem, we want you to implement a Moving Average algorithm.

A moving average algorithm is an algorithm that receives a positive integer X and return the average compared to the N latest numbers.
Constraints

N can be any number from 0 to 999999

0 < N < 999999

X can be any number from 0 to 9999999999

0 < X < 9999999999
Examples
MovingAverage(3)

add(3) == 3.0
add(4) == 3.5
add(5) == 4.0
add(4) == 4.333333333333333

MovingAverage(2)

add(3) == 3.0
add(4) == 3.5
add(5) == 4.5
add(6) == 5.5

MovingAverage(1)

add(3) == 3.0
add(4) == 4.0
add(5) == 5.0
add(6) == 6.0
